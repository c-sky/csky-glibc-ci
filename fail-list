FAIL cases:
1. nptl/tst-thread_local1
   seems lack c++ support, the gcc frountend can not generate constructor
   and destructor for static, anonymous_namespace and extern variables.
2. sunrpc/bug20790
   It fails because the testing environment lacks native cpp.
3. nptl/tst-_res1
   It fails because symbol _res is incorrect linked.
4. posix/tst-chmod
   some time fail, tst-chmod may pass after retry.
5. The following three cases some time get into deadlock when the child
   return before the parent thread start to wait. I don know what is
   the expect behaviour under this condition.
   misc/tst-clone3
   tst-mallocfork
   tst-mallocfork2
